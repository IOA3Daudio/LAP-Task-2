# Task-2 of the LAP challenge
Jiale Zhao, Dingding Yao, and Junfeng Li: Efficient Upsampling of Head-Related Transfer Functions With Spatially Extreme Sparse Measurements.

## Network training
The floder named `hrtf upsampling` houses the Python code used for training the hrtf upsampling neural network.
The floder named `itd upsampling` houses the Python code used for training the itd upsampling neural network.

run:
```
python train.py
```
to train the proposed model.
